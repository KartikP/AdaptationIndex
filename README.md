# AdaptationIndex

From Depannemaecker, D., Gorski, T. & Destexhe, A. Conductance-based Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire model. (2020) doi:10.1101/842823.

Takes spike times for a spike train (e.g. deconstructed burst spike train) and computes an adaptation index (-1,1). An index that is positive represents decelerating spike trains, while negative index is for accelerating spike trains.
